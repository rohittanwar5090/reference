                    Online courses created a huge buzz when they were introduced
                    as a practicable form of education which was on par with
                    conventional, in-person education. This buzz was accompanied
                    by heavy scepticism as well. People started believing a lot
                    of false narratives that were going around such as that
                    online courses are meant only for technologically gifted
                    people or that online courses are of inferior quality to
                    offline courses.

                <p className='py-4'>
                    With time though, the quality and popularity of online
                    courses grew rapidly with many people opting for them to add
                    new credentials to their resumes or to simply learn a new
                    skill. In fact, the global e-learning industry has since its
                    birth grew by 900% globally. Another stellar statistic
                    suggests that by 2026 the e-learning market will hit the
                    $336.98 billion mark, at a compound annual growth rate
                    (CAGR) of 9.1% from 2018 to 2026 (Syngene Research, 2019)
                    [1].

                    However, some of the sceptic beliefs are still doing the
                    rounds to this day. If you are someone who is looking to

                    While it is true that to access an online course you need to
                    have some basic computer skills such as how to browse
                    through a search engine, how to make digital payments,
                    troubleshooting internet connectivity issues etc., you don't
                    need to be super knowledgeable at operating a computer.
                    Course creators and developers are aware that not all online
                    learners are proficient in computer skills and therefore
                    work hard to create an easy to navigate user-interface that
                    is uncomplicated and does not become an obstacle in the
                    student's learning journey. Many platforms that host online
                    courses also provide users with proper documentation that
                    details the step by step guide on how to use the platform or
                    any additional software that may be required

                    One does NOT need to be a tech wizard to benefit from an
                    online course. If you happen to be a person who only has the
                    basic technology skills, with a little time and practice you
                    can still excel at the course just as much, if not more,
                    than a tech-savvy person.

                    One of the common misperceptions regarding online classes is
                    that online classrooms always hinder productive
                    teacher-student interaction. The root of this myth probably
                    lies in the fact that earlier versions of online teaching
                    programs did not offer many chances for students to interact
                    with their teachers and develop a functional professional
                    relationship with them. However, in recent times, there have
                    been multiple testimonials by experienced teachers stating
                    that online courses that encourage teacher-student
                    interactions have higher market demand than courses that
                    offer students an online environment with no facilitation to
                    communicate their doubts, thoughts and opinions. Due to
                    this, many course creators make sure that students applying
                    for their online class have ample opportunity to reach out
                    to them. They do so by including one or more of the
                    following provisions:

                    Communication between the students and the instructor is
                    imperative to create an effective learning environment and
                    to ensure positive course outcomes. Most course creators are
                    aware of this fact and to ensure their course is perceived
                    well by their students, provide various options to the
                    students to communicate with their teachers.

                    Many high-performing online courses incorporate a
                    student-centric method of instruction. Student-to-student
                    interaction is one of the three pillars of the
                    student-centred method of education
                    <a href="blog-detail-1.html">How To Provide Student-centric Online Education</a
                    >, therefore many course creators recognise the importance
                    of peer interaction.
                </p>
                <p className='py-4'>
                    Peer-to-peer interaction has been known to promote a healthy
                    sense of competition among students and also to help
                    students feel that they are a part of a community of
                    like-minded people pursuing similar interests. If students
                    interact with each other on a regular basis, they feel
                    comfortable sharing trivial doubts that they otherwise would
                    have shared with the instructor. This consequently results
                    in a reduction of the workload of the instructor. There are
                    many ways that an online teacher ensures student-student
                    interaction, some of these are:

                    Student-to-student interaction is central to online courses
                    and many online courses require regular peer interactions to
                    ensure an efficient and positive online learning
                    environment. Many course creators specifically enlist the
                    help of online learning platforms to provide a multitude of
                    opportunities to the students for peer interaction and
                    collaboration activities.

                    Classifying any online course as easy or difficult is
                    perceptive. It depends on the capabilities of the student
                    and the quality of the subject matter. Saying that online
                    courses are easy to complete would be a bit of an
                    overstatement. Several reports show that the completion rate
                    of many online courses is not very impressive. One of the
                    major reasons for this is that online courses demand
                    self-discipline and excellent time management skills.

                    Unlike in a traditional classroom setting, a student will
                    not have constant reminders from his teachers to revise the

                    Online students have to motivate themselves into attending
                    the online lectures, learning new concepts, sincerely giving
                    assessment tests and adhering to the submission deadlines.
                    Online courses also offer flexible time schedules and this
                    is where the student's time management skills come into
                    play.

                    Regardless of the fact that a student is enrolled in an

                    Some people hold the unfounded belief that the academic
                    standard of an online degree or certification is not the
                    same as that of traditional classes. But this simply is not
                    the whole truth. Yes, there are many online courses that
                    have poor instructional design and are ineffectively
                    delivered, but the same can be said for traditional programs
                    as well. The quality of the course is not determined by the
                    medium of its delivery but by the course material, the
                    teacher's instructional style etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another counter-argument that can be offered against this

                    learning platforms offer analytics tools that can help
                    educators learn about problem areas in their course and help
                    make changes to improve the course quality.

                <p>
                    The quality of a course is independent of the medium through
                    which it is delivered. In fact, many online courses are
                    created with the same rigorous standard that goes into
                    creating a course that is delivered in a brick-and-mortar
                    class.

                <p>
                    Now that you have a much better idea of what learning in an
                    online environment is actually like, you can look into your
                    choice of online courses with more careful consideration.
                    Signing up for high-quality online courses is an excellent
                    way of working on your personal and/or professional
                    development. As we have already established, online courses
                    are a perfectly viable alternative to traditional offline
                    courses. Well-designed online courses offer splendid
                    learning quality, a stimulating and engaging learning
                    environment and perhaps the most appealing benefit on the
                    list, which is the ease of access. So, instead of allowing
                    misplaced notions about online learning to hold you back,
                    focus on truth-based facts and open yourself up to the world

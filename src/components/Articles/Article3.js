                    In most virtual classrooms a single teacher is seen
                    instructing several students. While teachers often work
                    independently, they cannot — and should not — operate alone.
                    Merely giving out the lessons for the day and assigning
                    homework is not enough for the day to be deemed completed.
                    In order to facilitate an effective online learning
                    experience, teachers must take a student-centric approach in
                    their teaching methods. The student-centric method of
                    teaching (LINK TO EZCOLAB BLOG ON STUDENT-CENTRIC ONLINE
                    LEARNING) refers to instructional approaches or academic
                    support strategies that are created to address the learning
                    needs and interests of individual students as well as the
                    entire community of students. This approach majorly focuses
                    on collaborative activities and has been widely praised and
                    adopted by numerous members of the teaching domain.

                    Collaborative learning enables teachers and students to
                    share, communicate, and work together on common tasks by
                    sharing ideas, information and documents with each other.
                    The foundational value behind collaborative activities is
                    that when people come together to achieve a common goal they
                    learn better and perform better. Interactions such as a
                    teacher collaborating with other teachers, a student
                    collaborating with other students or even a student-teacher
                    collaboration for a specific task go a long way in ensuring
                    that everyone partakes and also that the final goal is met.

                    To facilitate collaborative activities certain software
                    tools called groupware or collaborative software are
                    available. This software ensures that communication and
                    coordination can occur in a streamlined process so as to
                    ensure a highly efficient virtual educational environment.
                    If you are a teacher and are contemplating whether you
                    should avail the services of collaborative software to
                    increase the engagement value for your students, you are in
                    the right place!

                    1. Reduction in Feeling of Isolation between Teachers and
                    Students:
                </h6>
                <p>
                    One of the most frequently noted criticisms that digital
                    learning receives is the lack of communication between the
                    students and the teacher. The current methods being employed
                    in virtual learning do not facilitate teacher-pupil
                    interaction which can result in the feeling of social
                    isolation. There is often no provision of a digital space
                    where the online students can virtually assemble to have a
                    productive interaction with their instructor or each other.
                    Various research reports have shown that when students are
                    presented with limited opportunities for communication with
                    their teachers and peers it results in weakened morale,
                    which can further lead to lower performance. One such report
                    was authored by Peter Shea named "Bridges and barriers to
                    teaching online college courses: A study of experienced
                    online faculty in thirty-six colleges" [1].
                </p>
                <p className='py-4'>
                    To combat this obstacle in the students' learning process
                    many teachers prefer to opt for the help of collaborative
                    software. Collaborative learning has been shown to develop
                    higher-order thinking skills in students and boost their
                    self-esteem as well. Engaging the students in group projects
                    and asking for their innovative ideas and opinions on the
                    lessons can maximize the educational experience by
                    demonstrating the material while improving social and
                    interpersonal skills. Student collaboration also leads to
                    community building which greatly motivates them to continue
                    learning with enthusiasm.

                    EZColab is a platform that course creators can use to build
                    and launch their online courses. One of the highlights of
                    EZColab is that it focuses on student-centric learning and
                    therefore recognises the need of facilitating productive
                    communication between students and teachers. EZColab has
                    built-in custom features like the Ideas Portal and
                    discussion forums like Minor Groups wherein students can
                    reach out to the teachers with any queries, doubts or
                    suggestions that they might have. Such collaborative culture
                    can greatly reduce the student's feeling of isolation from
                    their teacher and increase the student's sense of comfort.

                <h6 className=' text-[#2a3158] font-semibold py-4'>2. Ease of Content Sharing</h6>
                <p>
                    A good collaboration software enables a teacher to create
                    numerous files such as lesson plans, knowledge bases, home
                    assignments, projects and facilitates an easy sharing of
                    such diverse forms of media with the students who have
                    access to the software. This negates the need to use emails
                    or other messaging applications such as WhatsApp, Telegram
                    etc every time some course material is to be distributed.
                    One of the biggest advantages of having a collaborative
                    platform for content sharing is that it ensures that every
                    student will have access to the latest version of the course
                    material and that there are no unnecessary repetitions.
                </p>
                <p className='py-4'>
                    EZColab puts special emphasis on the collaboration aspect of
                    online learning and therefore offers excellent functionality
                    when it comes to sharing media files on its platform.
                    Sharing of all types of media files is supported including
                    text, audio, video and code files. Another vital feature
                    that sets EZColab apart from other collaboration software
                    available in the market is that it offers complete
                    encryption of video content. This means that all videos
                    uploaded by a teacher are completely secure and cannot be
                    downloaded or screen-recorded by the students.

                    Digital learning practices continuously evolve, which means
                    that online course creators need to keep adapting and
                    improving as well. In a research on the benefits of
                    collaboration for educators, which was led by Deborah
                    Butler, it was concluded that successful collaboration led
                    to teachers reflecting on their method of instruction,
                    making positive changes to their teaching practice and
                    gaining new knowledge about the importance of student
                    engagement [2]. If teachers partake in collaborative
                    activities it can also help them in utilizing formative
                    assessments to make sustained changes to their method of
                    instruction depending on the student response. Virtual
                    collaboration with fellow teachers or students can help the
                    teacher in gaining new perspectives that can make their
                    online course worth signing up for.

                    As a collaborative tool, EZColab is committed to
                    facilitating hassle-free communication between the teacher
                    and the student community in an online environment. Students
                    can post their queries and doubts anytime in the Minor group
                    of their class and their teachers can get back to them with
                    the solutions. This enormously benefits both parties as the
                    teacher gets to interact with the online learners and the
                    students start feeling more comfortable with their teachers
                    and also starts building a productive relationship with
                    them. The Ideas Portal feature at EZColab is another student
                    collaboration tool that provides the students with a space
                    to voice their creative ideas or suggest improvements to the
                    course material. Fellow students can then show their support
                    for this idea and teachers will immediately be notified.
                    This will aid the teachers to gain exposure to diverse
                    perspectives and challenge them to incorporate changes to
                    better suit the majority of their students.

                    A traditional classroom effectively promotes teacher-student
                    interaction and student-student interaction. In order to
                    stimulate a positive learning environment in virtual
                    classrooms, student engagement is of utmost importance. The
                    inclusion of collaborative tools in an online course leads
                    to positive student performance. Collaborative group
                    interactions promote active learning, shared knowledge base,
                    and peer-to-peer interaction. This consequently helps build
                    a foundation for learning. Collaboration also teaches the
                    students how to work well with others in real-life
                    situations. Collaborative projects help train online
                    learners for the modern workplace where teamwork is key.
                    This also helps in the development of soft skills of the
                    students such as:

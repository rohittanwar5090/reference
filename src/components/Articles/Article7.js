                    There has been a steady increase in the number of people
                    looking to sign up for online learning programs for the past
                    couple of years. The reasons for the aforementioned fact can
                    range from an inability to invest in a traditional classroom
                    program to a desire to gain new skills from the comfort of
                    one's home. In the wake of the novel coronavirus pandemic in
                    the year 2020, there was a large surge in the number of
                    people applying for online courses. Needless to say, the
                    eLearning industry witnessed a huge increase in market
                    share. According to a research report, the global E-learning
                    market was estimated at USD 144 Billion in 2019 and is
                    expected to reach USD 374.3 Billion by 2026. The global
                    E-learning Market is expected to grow at a compound annual
                    growth rate (CAGR) of 14.6% from 2019 to 2026 [1]. So if you
                    are someone who is considering joining the flourishing
                    online education industry, this is a fantastic time to jump
                    in. Before beginning a new venture, it is natural for a
                    person to have several doubts and concerns. This holds for
                    educators looking to utilise technology to further share
                    their expertise with interested students. Some of the
                    questions that might arise in the mind of someone looking to
                    create an online course are:

                    This guide will help you make the initial steps in your
                    journey of creating your online course and hopefully aid you
                    in creating a widely successful online program. So let's
                    dive right into the major steps you need to undertake-
                </p>
                <h6 className=' text-[#2a3158] font-semibold py-4'>1. Select your course topic:</h6>
                <p>
                    The first step of designing your online course is to choose
                    the course topic. Take the following points into important
                    consideration while doing so-
                </p>

                <h6 className=' text-[#2a3158] font-semibold py-4'>a) Play to your strengths:</h6>
                <p>Begin by asking yourself the following questions:</p>

                <ul className='list-disc p-6 px-10'>
                    <li>
                        What is an area in which your friends, family or
                        colleagues repeatedly ask for your expertise?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Is this an area of study where you are at a considerable
                        advantage over others?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you answered yes to the previous question, now ask
                        yourself if you are passionate about that area of study.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    It is imperative that you feel strongly motivated about the
                    subject you decide. The process of creating an online
                    program can feel long and daunting, especially if you are a
                    novice. If you feel passionate about teaching others about
                    your selected subject it will keep you motivated and push
                    you forward into completing it. If you love what you teach
                    it will drive you into thinking of out-of-the-box ways of
                    creating a learning journey that is totally unique and a
                    worthwhile venture for people to invest in. Besides, if you
                    are not passionate about the course topic that does come
                    across the students and the engagement value of your course
                    takes a hit.
                </p>
                <h6 className=' text-[#2a3158] font-semibold py-4'>b)Determining your topic's demand in the market:</h6>
                <p>
                    Another important aspect before selecting your course topic
                    is to establish if the subject you are offering is one which
                    people are interested in learning. If you are looking to
                    earn some capital through your online course you should also
                    consider the profit potential of the subject. Actively
                    research whether people are willing to invest their time
                    and/or money into the subject you want to teach. The average
                    sales price for courses in our dataset was $182.59 across
                    various e-learning platforms. However, the median course
                    price was found to be $76.50 [4]. Selecting your online
                    course topic is the foundational building block of your
                    program. Hence it is essential that you think very carefully
                    about these initial steps.
                </p>
                <h6 className=' text-[#2a3158] font-semibold py-4'>2. Research and Structure the Course:</h6>
                <p>
                    The next aspect of your online course creation process is
                    the research and planning phase. It is important to research
                    the subject extensively even if you have decades of
                    experience in the subject. Knowledge constantly evolves and
                    you need to evolve along with it. The key point here is to
                    note down all the sub-topics you are interested in including
                    in the course and also writing down the learning goals for
                    your course modules. You can follow, for example, this
                    course structure:
                </p>
                <p className='py-4'>
                    <strong>Course subject:</strong> Building fundamentals of

                <p>
                    <strong>-Main topic 1:</strong>
                    <em> Parts of Speech & Grammar Terminology </em>

                    <li>Subtopic: Sentence Structure and Formation</li>

                    <li>
                        Sub-Subtopic: Nouns, Pronouns, Verbs, Adjectives,
                        Adverbs,Prepositions, Interjections and Conjunctions
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong> â€“ Main topic 2:</strong>
                    <em> Rules and Usage </em>
                </p>
                <ul className='list-disc p-6 px-10'>
                    <li>Subtopic: Active and Passive Voice</li>
                    <li>Subtopic: Practices to improve grammar</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The organisation of the subject matter is of utmost
                    importance as an organised lesson plan is an effective
                    method in creating a positive impact on the students.
                    <strong>
                        You can also invest your time in performing keyword
                        research to figure out what words related to your subject
                        people frequently search for.</strong>
                    You can then choose to include some of these sought after
                    queries. As an additional step, you can also look into what
                    your would-be competitors are offering and decide on how you
                    can set your service apart from theirs. You can do this by
                    looking at their course layout and brainstorming about the
                    additional features that you could incorporate in your
                    course. Ask yourself what additional content you would want
                    from this course topic if you were a student,take note of
                    those points and add them to your course outline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Spend an ample amount of time in figure structure the
                    course. Decide on the course layout, the main topics and the
                    sub-topics and also plan how you mean to incorporate some
                    engaging activities in the course. Some of the examples of
                    engaging activities could be:
                </p>
                <ul className='list-disc p-6 px-10'>
                    <li>An assignment relating to different sub-topics</li>
                    <li>
                        A task for the students to create a project based on the
                        lesson.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can design mini-quizzes so that students can check
                        their comprehension of the subject along the way.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Making student pairs and assigning each pair a different
                        case-study
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Design your lesson layout carefully because it is most
                    likely that you would be displaying it to your target
                    audience. Hence it is essential that your potential students
                    find it well-ordered and easy to navigate. If you need some
                    help in designing a template for your course you can read
                    LearnWorld's blog post titled "18 Amazing Outline Templates
                    to use in Course Design" [3].

                <p>
                    After you are done with planning and structuring your
                    program you can begin focussing on creating and developing
                    the online course content. You can incorporate the study
                    material in form of simple text, animated slides, or even
                    engaging video lessons. There are several ways to get your
                    material across and it really just depends on your creative
                    skills and what you think the best medium is. Ultimately the
                    method of delivery you go with will decide the kind of media
                    production services you would need.
                </p>
                <h6 className=' text-[#2a3158] font-semibold py-4'>
                    But how do you get started with creating the actual content?
                </h6>
                <p>
                    If you are a subject matter expert and have been in the
                    teaching industry for a while, then you probably have some
                    of your old content with you. This content might be in the
                    forms of lecture notes, blog posts, presentations,
                    assignments or tests. Maybe you also have access to some
                    screen recordings of your old lectures or a video demo of
                    some practical experiment you might have performed. Whatever
                    old material you have access to can be repurposed and used
                    in your new course. This will save you a huge amount of time
                    in the content creation department and you can invest the
                    time saved during the production cycle.
                </p>
                <p className='py-4'>
                    However, if you are starting from scratch and don't have any
                    old material to refer to or maybe you simply can't locate
                    the old content that is perfectly fine too! In this case,
                    all you need to do to get started is make a skills
                    checklist. Follow the steps given to make one:
                </p>
                <ol type="1" className='list-decimal p-6 px-10'>
                    <li>
                        Write down a list of skills that you hope to deliver to
                        your students through your online program
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Go through the list and group the skills based on
                        similarity in skill type
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now divide the skill types based on the level of
                        complexity.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    With the basic framework of the content set, you can now
                    fill in the study material using old resources, new material
                    from different books, the internet etc.

                    weeks to 2 months in the production stage. You can then
                    invest a week or two into the editing process of the
                    post-production stage. You can refer to VdoCipher's "101

                    professional website would offer you greater autonomy and
                    more flexibility. You would be in charge of handling the
                    subscription policy and pricing of the courses you offer.
                    However, the responsibility of managing the marketing
                    campaign, accommodating different payment methods,
                    converting your target audience into actual customers also
                    falls on your shoulders. On the other hand, if you choose to
                    publish your course on an online education platform like
                    EZColab, you would have an easier time in setting up your
                    course, you would have access to several top-notch technical
                    features that EZColab offers. Opting for other e-learning
                    platforms like Udemy, SkillShare, Coursera etc will also
                    allow you to invest more time on course creation and less in
                    brainstorming about the advertising and marketing aspects of
                    the job.On the other hand, there are significant
                    disadvantages to using established platforms for publishing
                    your courses as well. You would have restrictive pricing
                    options and you would not be provided with access to
                    audience metrics. One of the biggest disadvantages would be
                    that your course would be placed next to similar courses,
                    resulting in your program being overshadowed, resulting in a
                    loss of profit for you.

                    It is advised that you conduct thorough research of these
                    pros and cons and go with the alternative that serves a
                    greater benefit to your professional life goals. Ask
                    yourself if you only want to focus on developing your course
                    and leave the marketing strategies to third parties. If your
                    answer is yes, then perhaps the better option for you would
                    be to publish your course on an online learning platform.
                    However, if you want to take full control of the experience
                    your course offers plus the access to audience metrics to
                    better understand what your students want, then you should
                    host your course on your professional website and EZColab is
                    always there to assist you in this process.

                <p>
                    A fantastic way of offering your students an amazing online
                    learning experience is to create a community for your online
                    course. It has long been established that while online
                    education has many advantages, it also brings a set of major
                    drawbacks. <a href="blog-detail-2.html">drawbacks</a> One of
                    these drawbacks is the prevailing sense of isolation between
                    students and their teachers. An excellent way to combat this
                    problem is to encourage communication among students who are
                    enrolled in the same learning program.
                </p>

                <p className='py-4'>
                    An online community of learners can promote peer-to-peer
                    interaction that can lead to the promotion of healthy
                    competition among students and also ignite a passion for
                    continuous learning. The presence of such a community can
                    also prove to be a respite for the instructor as they would
                    not have to shoulder the responsibility to answer every
                    query that a student might have. Instead, the students can
                    initiate interaction among themselves by discussing their
                    doubts and questions with each other, offering their
                    viewpoints and opinions and having harmonious discussions. A
                    constructive, vibrant conversation between students can
                    greatly increase the excitement in your online course.
                    Another advantage is that students can use this platform to
                    offer genuine feedback which is very important for any
                    instructor. Therefore fostering an online community of
                    students will positively impact the overall experience of
                    your online course and consequently result in a larger
                    magnitude of success.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are various ways you can establish a student community
                    for your course:
                </p>
                <ol type="a" className='list-roman p-6 px-10'>
                    <li>Create chat rooms on your website</li>
                    <li>
                        Create discussion forums and invite the students to join
                        them
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make group chats on the social media platform of your
                        choice
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    It can be a difficult process to carry out these processes
                    by yourself, hence using the services of an online
                    communication platform like EZColab, for building your
                    student community, is an excellent idea.
                </p>
                <h6 className=' text-[#2a3158] font-semibold py-4'>6. Get Feedback, Improve & Update:</h6>

                <p>
                    Constructive feedback is an integral part of any teaching
                    endeavour. The purpose of teaching is to educate students
                    and familiarise them with new knowledge that they previously
                    were strangers to. However, if a teacher keeps on giving out
                    lectures and study materials without taking a break to
                    determine whether the students were comprehending any of the
                    topics, it would be a sheer waste of time and energy for
                    both the parties involved.
                </p>
                <p className='py-4'>
                    Having an effective feedback mechanism associated with your
                    online course can help you check in with your students. It
                    can help you understand how much of the subject the students
                    are retaining and if they are having difficulty in coping
                    with the pace of the lesson plan or any of your teaching
                    methods. Do not be disheartened if you get some complaints
                    about your course. No learning program is a "one size fits
                    all" solution and different students will have different
                    learning capacities. You might find that you will have to
                    think of creative ways to adapt to the needs of different
                    students. You could simply speed up or slow down the pace of
                    the course to adjust to the needs of the students. Another
                    way of adapting to the feedback could be to create student
                    pairs wherein you pair a high-performing student with a
                    student who might be struggling in understanding the course.
                </p>
                <p className='py-4'>
                    Another important demographic that you can rely on for
                    feedback is that of your fellow educators. You can call upon
                    your colleagues or collaborate with other similar subject
                    matter experts to weigh in on your online course. Being
                    teachers themselves, they would have an eye for recognising
                    some mistakes you might have made or some suggestions on how
                    to improve the quality of the content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is imperative that you take all the feedback you receive
                    into consideration, think of ways to improve your course
                    according to it, implement those changes, then ask for
                    feedback again and repeat!

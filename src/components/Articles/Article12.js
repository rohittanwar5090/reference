                    yourself? Well, you are in the right place!

                    Nearly everybody in this world has a fond memory associated
                    with their favourite teacher in which the teacher helped,
                    inspired or challenged them to reach their true potential.
                    It is, therefore, no surprise that teaching is considered
                    one of the most respected and rewarding professions out
                    there. However, sometimes teacher salaries aren't always the
                    most remunerative, whereas in some cases, some teachers
                    simply want to set up a source of passive income and at the
                    same time make productive use of whatever free time they
                    have. Either way, it is common to see teachers searching for
                    ways to earn a bit of money from side-hustles. There are
                    many resources on the Internet that give out a list of jobs
                    that can help a person earn an extra income. However, in
                    this article, we have carefully formulated a list of the
                    absolute best side-hustles that are especially suited to
                    teachers. So without further delay, let's take a look at
                    some of the best side hustles that you as an educator can
                    select.

                    Hands down, one of the best ways to earn an additional
                    income while utilising your talent and doing a service to
                    society, is to create your own online course!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The online learning industry has grown exponentially in
                    recent years. More and more people have been opting for
                    online courses to learn new skills and make better use of
                    their time. As you already are in the profession of
                    educating people, you can tap into this ever-growing market
                    and earn a significant amount of part-time income.

                <p className='py-4'>
                    It is true that a lot of time and effort goes into creating
                    and selling an online course and most teaching jobs are
                    already quite demanding. One way to overcome this problem is
                    to utilise the summer months, when most schools are closed,
                    to brainstorm about what online course topic you should
                    choose and start the process of creating it. During other
                    breaks or on long weekends, you can set up your own
                    marketing campaign or start creating a new course.

                <p className='py-4' s>
                    Over the past several years, a fast-growing online market
                    for e-commerce of educational content has been established.
                    Many platforms have been facilitating the exchange as well
                    as the buying and selling of lesson plans, course material
                    and other resourceful material. Here teachers, homeschoolers
                    and tutors can access several helpful downloadable materials
                    sometimes for free and at times at a fixed price.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are an educator who has a few years of experience
                    under your belt, then it's safe to say you would have some
                    reliable teaching material that you rely upon. If this is
                    the case, you can make the most of the situation and earn
                    some extra money!

                <h6 className=' text-[#2a3158] font-semibold py-4'>1. Teachers Pay Teachers</h6>
                <p>
                    By far the most popular platform for this is Teachers Pay
                    Teachers (https://www.teacherspayteachers). It is used to
                    sell educational materials to other teachers. Over 1 billion
                    resources have been downloaded from the site, and in 2020
                    alone, 7 million teachers used Teachers Pay Teachers.

                <h6 className=' text-[#2a3158] font-semibold py-4'>2. Amazon Ignite</h6>
                <p>
                    The popularity of this concept rose so much that Amazon
                    created its own platform, called Amazon Ignite
                    (https://ignite.amazon.com/), that connects educational
                    content creators with Amazon customers. To sign-up for this
                    platform, you would have to request an invitation and after
                    filling out an application form you would be free to sell
                    your teaching material there.

                    This is a great way to make money with the curriculum and
                    resources you’ve already created for your classes which
                    means you would not have to invest extra time for this.
                    However, you should keep in mind that the amount of money
                    you earn will solely depend on the number of people who buy
                    your products.

                <h6 className=' text-[#2a3158] font-semibold py-4'>3. Blogging</h6>
                <p>
                    Blogging isn't just an option for an English teacher, if you
                    are someone who enjoys writing and has a knack for it, you
                    should dabble your toes in the world of blogging!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pick a niche that you are passionate about and that can
                    attract other people's attention as well. For example,
                    teacher bloggers often base their blogs on subjects such as:
                </p>
                <ol type="i" className='list-roman p-3 px-5 lg:p-6 lg:px-10'>

                        Reviews based on educational products such as eBooks,
                        online courses etc.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    It is important to note that writing impressive blog posts
                    won't translate into an immediate income stream, it can take
                    months for you to see a profit. That is because you start
                    earning money from a blog once you have established an
                    audience for it and then utilise ad services and affiliate
                    links to bring in the cash. That being said, it is a job
                    that offers flexible work hours as you decide and control
                    your own working hours and it is a relatively cheap
                    endeavour to undertake.

                <p>
                    Maybe you are a person with an intriguing story to tell or a
                    knowledgeable experience to dispense, but you don't want to
                    start a blog on it. The other option here is to write your
                    book and get it published. This is not only a great way to
                    earn money but also doubles as a creative outlet!
                </p>
                <p className='py-4'>
                    You can tap into your vivid imagination and create an
                    escapist world with a fictional story or author a
                    non-fiction book to generate an extra income for yourself.
                    The traditional route of getting your book published by a
                    reputed publishing house is always a good option, however,
                    self-publishing is an excellent alternative as well.
                    Numerous services such as Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing,
                    CreateSpace, IngramSpark etc. offer self-publishing services
                    to new and experienced writers. Since the money you generate
                    from your book depends solely on how well it performs in the
                    market, it is not guaranteed that you would earn a whole lot
                    from it. But selling your own book is still one of the best
                    side-hustles out there as royalty rates can range from 35%
                    to 70%, which is pretty lucrative.

                <p>
                    Since you are an educator it is a given that you would have
                    a pretty good idea of what works and what does not when it
                    comes to lesson plans and course material. The good news is
                    that you can put that knowledge to use by becoming a
                    curriculum developer.
                </p>
                <p>Curriculum building comprises of the following tasks:</p>

                    <li>

                        topics, sub-topics etc
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Designing lesson plans that align with the standards of
                        the local or national education board

                </ol>
                <p>
                    One of the most rewarding aspects of the job is that you
                    have the power, and therefore the responsibility, to
                    construct the entire learning pathway from start to finish
                    and help other teachers and students in the process.

                <h5 className=' text-[#2a3158] font-semibold py-4'>10. Proofreading</h5>
                <p>
                    Proofreading is a worthwhile side-hustle to consider,
                    especially if you are a teacher. As part of your job
                    description, you are already expected to read through and
                    correct your students' essays, assignments, tests etc. and
                    that is what proofreaders do as well. Proofreaders are
                    usually the last people who are put in charge of going over
                    a piece of content to make corrections to any spelling,
                    grammatical, and punctuation errors before the content is
                    published.
                </p>
                <p className='py-4'>
                    Most proofreading jobs do not ask for specific academic
                    qualifications, however, having a degree in the language
                    under concern and/or experience in writing are often given
                    priority. It is also worth noting that freelance
                    proofreaders aren’t always paid hourly, sometimes they get
                    paid based on the length of the content that they have
                    edited.

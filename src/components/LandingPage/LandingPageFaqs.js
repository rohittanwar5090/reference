                                    The payments are being converted from USD to INR as we are only collecting payments in our domestic currency- Indian Nation Rupee (INR). The price plan, however, remains in the USD. Donâ€™t worry, you will only be paying the amount mentioned under the plan. For example, if you have selected a Tier 3 plan worth $299, you will be charged only $299, no more no less. Sorry for the inconvenience.
